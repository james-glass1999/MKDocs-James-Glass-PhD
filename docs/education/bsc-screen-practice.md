# BSc Screen Practice – University of Paisley

## What is Screen Practice?
A practical, production-led degree focused on **documentary filmmaking** and **broadcast journalism**. It covered the full factual workflow from **research and access** through **shooting, interviewing, scripting to picture, editing, and compliance** for TV and digital platforms.

## Why it Matters
- Builds real-world skills for factual storytelling and public-interest journalism  
- Emphasises ethical practice, accuracy, and legal awareness  
- Trains collaboration under deadline pressure across camera, sound, and edit  
- Produces portfolio work (packages/short documentaries) ready for industry

## What Screen Practice Combines
- **Documentary development** — research, treatments, pitching, access & consent  
- **Interviewing & reporting** — question design, presenter links, vox pops  
- **Location production** — single-camera shooting, B-roll coverage, lighting on location  
- **Audio for factual** — dialogue capture, atmos, basic mixing  
- **Post-production** — logging/transcripts, paper edits, assembly → fine cut, captions  
- **Journalism practice** — news values, scripting to pictures, rundowns, editorial workflows  
- **Law & ethics** — accuracy, fairness, right of reply, privacy, defamation, compliance  
- **Multiplatform** — versions for web/social, subtitling and accessibility

## What I Did
- Produced and directed short documentaries and news packages  
- Researched contributors, secured access, prepared briefings and consent forms  
- Conducted on-camera interviews and gathered supporting B-roll on location  
- Wrote scripts to picture for voiceover/presenter links and edited end-to-end  
- Managed production paperwork (schedules, risk assessments, releases)

## Skills I Gained
- **Project management & production delivery** — scoping, schedules, milestones; production run-downs; delivery specs and versioning  
- **Research & access** — background research, fact-checking, contributor care  
- **Interviewing** — building rapport, open/closed questioning, on-camera technique  
- **Camera & lighting** — single-camera operation, natural/practical lighting on location  
- **Sound** — clean dialogue capture (shotgun/lavs), monitoring, basic mix  
- **Editing** — logging, paper edits, story structure, pacing, exports & captions  
- **Editorial judgement** — news values, right of reply, balance, compliance awareness  
- **Documentation & safety** — risk assessments, call sheets, release forms, location permissions  
- **Collaboration** — working in small crews, time management, clear comms under deadline

## Looking Back
The programme cemented my interest in factual storytelling and gave me a disciplined approach to **research, editorial standards, and on-location production**.

## Looking Ahead
These foundations transfer directly to modern factual content for broadcast and digital—short documentaries, news features, and branded factual pieces across platforms.
