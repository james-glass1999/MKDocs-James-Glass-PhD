## What Drives Me

I’m passionate about **simplifying complexity**. Whether it’s translating intricate technical details into accessible documentation or enabling developers to succeed through knowledge sharing, my focus is always on clarity and impact.  

I also have a growing interest in **artificial intelligence and AI agents** — particularly how they can enhance documentation, developer workflows, and knowledge management. I enjoy exploring ways that intelligent systems can support writers, improve content discoverability, and make technical information more interactive and accessible.

Outside of work, I find balance and inspiration through creative and active pursuits:  

- 📸 **Photography** – capturing moments and exploring visual storytelling.  
- 🥾 **Hiking** – enjoying nature and disconnecting from screens.  
- 🎬 **Movies** – from thought-provoking documentaries to imaginative cinema.  

I’m also fascinated by the intersection of **technology, media, and human behavior**, and how innovations like AI are reshaping the way we create, consume, and share information.
