## Reasonable Demands For Electrical CAD

We all know exemplary electrical CAD design, electrical calculation and photovoltaic software falls flat without a solid service to back up the software being used.  And that’s why it makes perfect sense to include Trace Software International when deciding on your new software solution.

A CAD model must efficiently and accurately represent every part in your company’s product and the intricate relationship between each part of the design. To increase efficiency, designers should be able to design a quality product in CAD with as few steps as possible. A CAD software that offers the best value will combine exceptional technical effectiveness for designs.

Choose a CAD software that has a global reputation in your industry and supplier community. This choice will help eliminate the need to translate files from one system to another. Translation of files takes time and can introduce errors.

## Key Factors

### Intelligent & Efficient Software

#### Choose The Right Electrical CAD Software
When deciding on a CAD software for your business it is necessary to find out how efficient each software package is at creating the types of products your company makes for the end-user.

For example, if your company produces solar panels for the energy sector, pay special attention to the aids for modelling, simulations and precise yield calculation. Or if your firm designs and produces stylish products, it will be necessary to analyse the required tools for manufacturing freeform modelling surfaces and blends between them. Designers of machinery should see how easy it is to assemble large numbers of parts and insert purchased parts such as fasteners from a library. Industrial and product designers should consider tools that can generate high-quality surfaces to realize their stylish designs where smooth, organic appearances are paramount.

Changes often occur in the design process, so it’s essential to make this as efficient and reliable as possible. Eliminating 10 percent of the steps in your current process can add significant cost benefits to your business and the product being produced.

### Compatibility With Customers & Suppliers

In our modern world, few manufacturers do not have the ability to be vertically integrated in the design process to final product. Many depend on a global collection of suppliers for tools, parts, subsystems, production equipment, and design services. A lot of businesses or customers complain about the slow conversion process required for sharing files with others, who cannot open your current system file formats.

The benefits of exchanging electrical CAD files with customers and suppliers, is enormous. It is essential to find out how easy it is to import or export file properties and bills of materials. Look at each system’s ability to import files from other systems. Ideally, your electrical CAD software should be able to exchange information (import, and export files) in formats such as .PDF, .XLS, or .DWG. Also, it is also essential to make sure the software supports international standards such as STEP, IGES, VDA, and IDF.

By having the correct software in place, it is possible to save hundreds of hours per week of scheduled time exchanging CAD files with customers or suppliers and it is more cost effective than having to redraw designs to fit format types. The ability to collaborate effectively in three dimensions on products and processes can considerably reduce costs while helping to deliver better products.

Evaluate the tools for repairing damage to imported shapes, how easy they are to use, and how well they work. If your firm must translate many files from several brands of CAD systems, check out the direct translators available with each CAD system and also those from third parties that specialize in translation software.

### Errors Verification

#### Cost-Free Correction Of Program Errors
Due to the rapid growth of technical innovation and development, no software on the market today is 100 percent error free. It is necessary to know what will happen if you come across an error within the program?

The reaction time of the software provider is essential and how this future support will be useful:

- Is it a minor or a major error?
- Do you get a proper support so that you can get a solution here and now?
- Will the program developers then correct the error and update your program for free?
- Or do you have to wait for the next version of the program, which you will not be able to get before the end of next year?
- Do you then have to pay for the corrected version?

Designs don’t make money until physical products are delivered. Look for CAD software with a rich variety of applications that can reduce manual and error-prone tasks, but also enhance your testing, machining and cost estimating.

### Drafting Tools That Meet Your Standards

Even though you’ll be designing products using your electrical CAD software, your suppliers and factory workers will need clear drawings that will show information that isn’t obvious in a 2D/3D model: critical dimensions and tolerances, material and surface-finish specifications, and notes about processing such as curing or heat treatment. Be sure any 3D CAD system you buy can make drawings to your current standards for dimensions, tolerances, lettering, and parts lists. And be sure your drawings can be exported in popular formats such as PDF, DXF, and DWG.

Extensive testing can make the difference between a successful product and one that fails in the field. Look for capabilities that help you reduce the number of physical tests by simulating physical behaviour, such as kinematics, dynamics, stress, deflection, vibration, temperatures or fluid flow. Software for designing electrical wiring can help reduce errors and ensure machinery is wired correctly. Cost-estimating software enables designers to hit cost targets by revising designs sooner instead of waiting for estimators to say they are over budget.

To make sure you have the best tools, choose a CAD platform that gives you a broad choice of solutions that will help you get your job done faster and more efficiently.

The importance of design analysis continues to grow as companies strive to be more efficient. Saving material saves money, but preventing unexpected design failure is even more vital.

### Reliability & Stability

3D design systems are more complex than 2D drawing systems. With all that code, it’s harder to get the bugs out. Unfortunately, there are no standard measures of reliability for CAD as there are for many types of systems and machinery. Browse customer forums for frequent reports about instability or software bugs.

If your company makes large assemblies, be sure any CAD system you buy is capable of handling them efficiently. Some systems slow to a crawl when handling complex designs with high part counts. Pay particular attention to assembly performance if your products contain complex freeform shapes, helical sweeps, or arrays of holes or other features.

Make sure your electrical CAD software can handle designing large assemblies which can help reduce not only design time, but testing, machining, cost estimating, and inspection. Some systems slow to a crawl when handling complex designs with high part counts. Companies that design systems to order, can benefit from software that generates parts and assemblies automatically in response to customer specifications.  Because physical testing is costly and slow, you should look to reduce the number of physical tests by simulating physical behaviour, such as kinematics, dynamics, stress, deflection, vibration, temperatures, or fluid flow.

To make sure you have the best tools, choose a CAD platform that gives a broad choice of solutions. It should have an extensive and well-documented application programming interface (API).

### Pleasant Business Relationships

Believe it or not, some of the greatest sources of friction between buyers of CAD software and their customers are the nontechnical business aspects of the relationship. Just as some airlines annoy customers with extra fees for checked baggage, flight changes, drinks, and blankets, some CAD suppliers levy hidden charges for software and services that most customers need.

To avoid aggravation and lower your costs, look for suppliers who offer straightforward software packages that have everything you need. Look at the terms for floating licenses that enable designers who don’t need CAD full-time to share licenses. And be sure your best designers can use the software both at work and at home without hassles.

Small teams with more than just a few designers to global teams collaborating across different continents can benefit from having a product data management (PDM) system integrated within their CAD tool. Because relationships among files in 3D systems are so complex, an automated system to store and organize them is vital for project coordination.

Without PDM, designers can unknowingly overwrite each other’s work, redo parts that have already been designed and send the wrong revision levels to manufacturers. Together, these sorts of errors can waste hundreds of hours of work each year and thousands of dollars in defective parts.

### Built-In Applications That Help Your Business

Make sure your business systems are compatible with your electrical CAD software, and allow collaboration among them, so systems such as ERP, and PLM, may exchange data with your electrical CAD.

An electrical CAD software can be even more productive with special-purpose software for design automation and analysis. If you need to simulate physical behaviour such as kinematics, dynamics, stress, deflection, vibration, temperatures, or fluid flow, look for a system that has integrated analytical tools or efficient interfaces to your preferred analysis software.

Does your company make products that are variants of a common type such as moulds, stamping dies, conveyors, or production equipment? If so, look for a supplier that has integrated software to automate the design of your products.

If you need to simulate physical behaviour such as kinematics, dynamics, stress, deflection, vibration, temperatures, or fluid flow, look for a system that has integrated analytical tools or efficient interfaces to your preferred analysis software.

PDM systems can do much more than just store and organize files. They can help designers find existing parts to re-use instead of reinventing them. PDM systems also generate material lists for cost estimating and feed data to manufacturing resource planning (MRP) systems. More advanced PDM software can automate change-control processes to assure that out-of-date or unreleased information isn’t sent to factories or suppliers.

### Short Learning Curve

#### Getting Qualified Employees
Adopting 3D methods requires training and experience. So, choose a system that’s easy to learn as well as capable. Look for a system that has a consistent user interface throughout. Be sure design and drafting procedures flow logically from start to finish. Some systems have hidden dungeons and dragons that stop designers halfway through a task and make them start over.

Developing your own training materials is costly. Choose a system with built-in tutorials, a rich array of computer-based training aids, and a vibrant online community that lets workers ask questions and get answers. You’ll also want a system that’s taught in local schools and universities so you can hire students who are ready to work.

You want to make sure you can get the support you need. Select a reseller who can meet these demands with ongoing training courses and superior technical support. You also want to keep an eye out for which CAD systems schools and universities are using so you can hire students who are ready to work.
