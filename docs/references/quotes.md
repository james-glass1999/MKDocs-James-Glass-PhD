!!! quote "I’ve been lucky to have James as my manager. He leads by example, hard working, clear headed under pressure, and always willing to roll up his sleeves when the team needs him. He balances strategic direction with hands on support. No matter how packed his calendar is, he always makes time for his team: to unblock you, coach through a career or life decision, or simply check in on how you’re doing. His care builds deep trust within the team. He also creates an environment where ideas are heard, ownership is encouraged, and performance is driven through clarity and empowerment, not control. He’s open minded and receptive to feedback. He proactively collaborates with other teams to find the most impactful initiatives for the team. He’s also a great communicator with strong technical writing skills."
